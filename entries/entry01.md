# Entry 1

When thinking about a website to make, I have been considering many topics., but one that stood out to me was oceanography. I’m very interested in the ocean and all of they different things that live there. Since I really interested into living creatures or life in the ocean, so I decided to add a little or marine biology.

Since i’m interested in information about the ocean, to create this website, I will be needing to use many skills. Since I'm in the beginning stage I will start to create a website to inform young people about the ocean. Now I have to find an issue with the ocean, and what oceanographers do. I had to get some information about the topic, so I went to https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/oceanographer.html to find some basic informsation about oceanography. Problems in the ocean is caused by humans, so I want to find a way to solve an issue. Now I need to use my skills in software engineering to inform people. That is the only way I could save the ocean, because I cannot physically do something in the ocean. This lead me to have an idea to create a website to create an impact in the world's ecosystems.

To do this I need skills to achieve this goal is consideration, and creativity. I believe these skills will help to attract people to my website I need to be creative. The purpose of this, so I could get the reader's attention. This will help the reader to be eager to read, and understand why the ocean is important to save, and help. Now the skill of consideration is important, because if I want to make a website I have considerate my readers, because the will help me make my decision to choose the ocean.

In the engineering design process, I am in the early stages: defining the problem. My goal for next time is the research stage.
