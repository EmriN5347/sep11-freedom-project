# Entry 1

When thinking about a website to make, I have been considering many topics., but one that stood out to me was oceanography. I’m very interested in the ocean and all of they different things that live there. Since I really interested into living creatures or life in the ocean, so I decided to add a little or marine biology.

Since i’m interested in information about the ocean, to create this website, I will be needing to use many skills. Since I'm in the beginning stage I will start to create a website to inform young people about the ocean. Now I have to find an issue with the ocean, and what oceanographers do. I had to get some information about the topic, so I went to https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/oceanographer.html to find some basic informsation about oceanography. Since I'm on the define stage of this website, I had to use the skill how to read, so I was able to skim through articles to get information about Oceanography, and the problems related to it. Another Skill I used was organization, this skill was useful because I was able to take some notes that I’m able to use for my website. Since I was organized I am able to understand were each part of info belongs to. After all of this, my goal is to move up to the brainstorm or research phase of this website.
